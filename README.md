# PythonDataScienceHandbook
This is a dense content for quick read and application by Chinese language.

I read the PythonDataScienceHandbook(https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)

Author is Jake VanderPlas.

I apperaciate Jake VanderPlas's work. Let help me to learn Python for data science.

I was a R coder who want to learn more software skills.

My plan is to make a quick Python introduction and omit some details which I personally think

that is not very important for you to access data by Python. But still recommand to read the handbook and suport the author.

I'll introduce four parties.

1. [Use Numpy to control data](https://github.com/CharliePHLee/PythonDataScienceHandbook\NumPy.md)
2. Use Pandas to access data
3. Use Matplotlib to visualize data
4. Scikit-Learn package for machine learning

Let's go to [main page](https://github.com/CharliePHLee/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/Main%20Page.md) to learn using Python
